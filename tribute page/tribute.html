                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. Known for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, Gandhi led numerous peaceful protests, including the famous Salt March of 1930, which became symbols of the struggle for freedom.

                    Educated as a lawyer in London, Gandhi initially worked in South Africa, where he developed his ideas about civil rights. Returning to India, he became a key figure in the Indian National Congress, advocating for self-rule through non-cooperation and civil disobedience. Gandhi's principles of truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspired movements worldwide.
                    
                    His commitment to social reforms extended beyond independence, as he worked to eliminate untouchability, promote religious harmony, and uplift rural India. Despite facing imprisonment and numerous challenges, Gandhi remained steadfast in his belief in nonviolence.
                    
                    Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy endures as a global symbol of peace and justice, inspiring leaders and movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
